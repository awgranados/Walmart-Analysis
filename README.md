# Customer Purchase Data Analysis (Walmart Sales Dataset)

This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of customer purchase behavior using the Walmart Sales dataset from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on customer segmentation, purchase trends, product performance, and key factors influencing high-value purchases.

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze customer purchase data to uncover patterns in spending behavior, identify high-value customer segments, and make data-driven recommendations for marketing and business strategies.

Key features of the analysis include:

- **Customer Segmentation**: Identifying and analyzing high-value customers based on their purchasing patterns.
- **Product Performance**: Assessing which products generate the most revenue and uncovering co-purchase trends.
- **Demographic Insights**: Analyzing purchase behavior by age, gender, city, and other demographic factors.
- **Business Recommendations**: Providing data-backed suggestions for optimizing marketing strategies and improving sales.

## Skills and Techniques Used

### Data Visualization

- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Created informative and visually appealing charts to present key insights from the data, such as bar plots, heatmaps, and pie charts. These visualizations effectively communicate customer purchase behavior, product performance, and demographic trends.
- **Custom Plot Styling**: Designed custom visualizations with clear labels, color palettes, and annotations to ensure clarity and highlight important insights in the analysis.

### Business Analysis

- **Segmentation & Insights**: Analyzed purchasing patterns and customer demographics to identify high-value customer segments, which are critical for targeted marketing efforts.
- **Revenue Optimization**: Provided actionable business recommendations to improve sales through targeted marketing, product bundling, and personalized offers based on customer purchase behavior.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Delivered data-backed suggestions for marketing campaigns aimed at high-value customer groups, focusing on the 5,000â€“10,000 purchase range to maximize revenue.

### Python

- **Data Processing & Analysis**: Used Python, specifically the **Pandas** library, to clean, preprocess, and manipulate large datasets. This includes handling missing data, aggregating purchase data, and filtering data for analysis.
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Employed Python techniques such as grouping, value counts, and aggregations to uncover spending trends and product performance. Python was also used to generate summary statistics and correlations to identify key insights.
  
### Data Analysis

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand underlying patterns and relationships. This included analyzing customer demographics, spending behaviors, and product category performance.
- **Co-Purchase Analysis**: Analyzed frequently co-purchased products to identify opportunities for product bundling and cross-selling, using filtering and aggregation techniques.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored correlations between demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, city) and spending behavior to make data-driven marketing recommendations.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Used Python for all data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning, including handling missing data and aggregating purchase data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating clear and informative visualizations, presenting key findings from the data.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Utilized Jupyter Notebook for conducting and documenting the analysis in an interactive and reproducible environment.
